I sat silent, and a long pause followed. Then I began once more: “Let me
ask you, Daniel; perhaps you do not understand how difficult it is for
one mind to believe that it cannot grasp what is in another mind. But
this—this knowledge to which you have come—you must surely have come to
it by degrees, by a process?”

“Yes,” said he.

“And of that—surely you could explain to me at least the beginning,
which might help me to divine in what the difference consists?”

He answered nothing for a moment; I went on quickly: “Ah, I fear that
there must be another reason that you do not realise. Might it not be
true that you would find it easier to explain to another than to me? Is
it not at all that you shrink from my ways of thinking? Is it not that
you know that I have never understood your art?”

“Tell me,” he asked suddenly, “what have you thought about me since you
have been here?”

“What difference does it make what I think?” I cried. “What data have I
for thinking anything? I know that I am in the presence of something
which haunts me; and also that I have never been more wretched in my
life.

“Ah, Daniel,” I cried, “be fair with me—you have not been fair! Why
should you shrink from me as if I were a base person? What harm could it
do, even if I did not understand you? I cannot help it—the effect of
this thing upon me; I am a grown man, and yet you have turned me into a
child again. If you were to tell me about ghosts, I think I should take
it for the truth.”

“Ah,” said my brother.

“Yes, even that!” I cried. “But you think I am not worthy even to guess
at your life and your knowledge—no, do not try to stop me, I know that
this is the fact! If it were not so, you would trust to love—you would
not cast me away from you, you would do what you could!”

“Be still! Be still!” he whispered. “Do not speak to me that way—I will
do what I can—I will tell you what I am able.”

For a long time he sat with knit brows. Then at last he began his story.

“I go back,” he said, “to the time when I first landed on this island.
The ship was wrecked upon the bar just ahead of us; and later, when the
sea fell, we set to work to save from it as much as we could. The voyage
had restored my health, and I had my violin; and when I ascertained that
the place sheltered no wild beasts or men, I was myself well content to
remain as long as might be necessary. I had no doubt that some ship
would appear in the end; and meanwhile there was nothing to trouble me,
except the enforced companionship of men who did not understand me. In
the end, I escaped from that trouble with the plea that if I took up my
residence at the other side of the island I could better watch the sea;
and so I built a tiny hut, and was, I think, as happy as I had ever been
before.

“But as the months passed by and no vessel appeared, the situation
changed. I perceived that sooner or later my violin would be useless;
and about the same time the sailors came to me to say that they had
decided to rig a boat with a sail, and endeavor to reach some inhabited
island. It was the time of quiet seas, and they preferred to run the
risk to remaining longer in isolation.

“I was then called upon to make the great decision. Should I chance my
life with the rest, or should I trust to the certainty that some day a
vessel would appear, and meanwhile devote myself to the work which
loomed before me—the living of my life, the seeking of the power which I
felt to be hidden in me, without any external assistance or reference
whatever? Perhaps had I seen the twenty years before me, I should have
shrunk from the task; but, as it was, I chose what was to be the bolder,
to my companions the more timid, course.

“After that, of course, there could be no halfway measures. I had to
make good my purpose; I had to face either absolute victory or absolute
defeat. As I had expected, my violin soon became useless, and, no ship
appearing, I perceived in the end that I had to give up that thought,
too.

“I have already hinted the grounds of my argument to you. It is my
belief that life is its own end, and needs no justification. It is also
my belief that each individual soul is a microcosm self-sufficient, and
its own excuse for being. Each day as I wrought, I came to be more and
more possessed with that truth, it came to be more and more self-evident
and final; until at last there came a day when I would not have hailed a
ship had I seen one—when the life that loomed up before me within my own
heart was a thing of so much interest that the rest of the world was
nothing in comparison.

“At first I had felt just as you feel now—I had been interested in food
and clothing and light, and what not else; but in the end I found myself
behaving as a soldier upon a long campaign—I strewed my path with the
things that had once been necessities, and that now were encumbrances.
It proved thus with my violin—strings or no strings; the music that
throbbed in my soul and swept me away into the far spaces of my being—it
was no longer to be limited and restrained by what human fingers could
achieve. It was as if I had once plodded upon the land and now
discovered wings. When the vision came to me, I no longer toiled for
weeks to shape it and record it—I went on where the new light shone,
where the new hope beckoned; and so, day after day, toward things with
which it is not easy for words to deal.”

My brother paused for a while; I did not speak.

“When I try to talk to you of these things,” he said at last, “I do not
know where I stand. I find myself thinking of the brother I remember—who
was content to call himself a materialist. You ask me what was this life
that I speak of—was it thought, was it motion, was it will? It was all,
I think; always it involved contemplation, the beholding of a universe
of being, and the comprehending of it as an utterance of power; and
always it was emotion, the flooding of one’s being with an oceantide of
joy and exultation; and always it was will—it was the concentration of
all the powers of one’s soul in one colossal effort. But chiefest of
all, I think—and what is hardest even to hint at—it was the fourth, and
the highest of the faculties of the mind—it was imagination.

“It is endless—that is the first thing that a man learns about it—it is
the very presence of the infinite. And also he learns that it is at his
command—that it is no accident, but his being itself; that he has but to
call, and it comes; that he has but to knock, and it is opened unto him.
It is that for which pilgrims and crusaders have fought, which prophets
and saints have sung. And it is that, of course, which is the life of
music. Music lies nearest to this mystery; to him who understands, it is
the living presence of the spirit. Its movement is the building up of
that ecstasy, its complexity is the infiniteness of that vision—all the
fulness and the wonder and the glory of it are there.”

I give but my recollection of my brother’s words. He paused again and
sat gazing before him. “I do not know,” he said, “how much these
metaphors convey to you. A long time had passed—some eight years, I
imagine, though I kept no count of the time. I was coming bit by bit to
a new and strange experience—one which is not of this life, and one
which would seem to you, I imagine, as altogether supernatural.

“So,” said Daniel, “you must believe me as you can. I have spoken of
strange bursts of vision, sudden gleams of insight which shake one’s
being to its depth. Such experiences are not unusual—poets have sung of
them; but now there came to be something which, strange as it may sound,
seemed to be not of a kind with my own soul—something which affected me
with an indescribable _fear_. I fought against the thought, for I had no
belief in the unseen. I strive to put into words something that cannot
be put into words—but I was like a man groping in utter darkness, and
touching something _alive_. I had fought my way into this unknown land,
and everywhere I had gone, so far, the things that I achieved were of my
own power, the impulses were those of my own will. But now, day by day,
I was haunted by the unthinkable suspicion that into my life was coming
something that was not myself. I was a bird mounting upon the air—and
the air had a will of its own! It was something that repelled
me—something that drew me. I wrestled with the thought day and night,
comparing it with anything of which I had ever heard or known. But in
vain—it was new to me.

“These things of which I speak you must understand as happening in the
midst of a tempest of emotions; I sat in a state which there is no
imagining—I ate nothing for days, I sat for days without moving, until
at last there came the climax, a desperate resolve, a mounting up, a
battling with unseen forces, a knocking upon unseen doors—and then a
sudden rending away of barriers, and the inpouring of a sea of life. I
can only use metaphors. I was a traveller, and I had toiled towards the
sunrise, climbing peak upon peak, and suddenly I had stepped out upon
the summit, and stood transfixed with the glory of an endless vision of
dawn.”

My brother’s voice had sunk to a whisper, and his hand lay upon my arm.
I cannot tell how his words had affected me.

“And this—this thing——” I ventured. “It is real?”

“It is real,” he said; “there is nothing else so real.”

“And it—it is a heaven?”

“No,” he said, “it is another earth.”

I started.

“As a scientist,” he said—“what do you believe about the universe? Is
there life throughout it?”

“I do not know, it is a possibility.”

“Yes,” said Daniel; “but for me it is a certainty. It is a fact in which
I live, day after day.”

I had caught him by the arm.

“Daniel!” I cried.

“It is just so,” he said.

“Another planet?”

“I do not know,” was the answer. “Another race of beings, is all that I
can tell you.”

“And are they human beings?”

“They have passed entirely beyond anything which those words can mean to
me.”

“And you know them?”

“Yes.”

“And personally?”

“More than personally.”

“How do you mean?”

“I know them directly. I live in their lives. I know them as I know the
symphony I hear—as one drop of water knows the sea.”

I was dazed; I could hardly think. “And their name?” I asked.

“They have no name,” said my brother, “they have no words. They have
passed the need of language—they communicate with each other by
immediate spiritual union. Their life is upon a higher plane than ours;
they do not deal in ideas, but in imaginative intuitions.”

“And then, Daniel, when you—when you pass into that trance—it is that!”

“It is that,” said he. “By an effort of my will I lift myself into their
consciousness; but because my physical and mental faculties have not
been prepared by long ages of development, my time with them is limited,
and I fall back to recruit my strength.”

“And this has been going on for years?”

“For ten or twelve years,” was his reply.

It will, perhaps, be best for me to give the substance of what he told
me in the long conversation which ensued. “I do not know where these
people are,” he told me. “I only know that throughout universal space
they are the race which is nearest in its development to our own. I do
not know what they look like. I have never seen nor heard them. I only
live their lives. I do not ask them any questions; our relation is
nothing of that sort. It is as if they were playing music which I heard;
but also as if their music was their whole life, so that I know all they
have and do. Their presence comes to me as the inwelling of universal
joy; of love and worship and rapture, unending and unthinkable. Their
life is infinite variety—immediate and perpetual expansion—spiritual
insight developing in a ratio determined by the will of the individuals.
It is as if a man were to witness the springtime arising of Nature, but
taking place in an hour instead of three months; and he comprehending
it, not from the outside, but living it, as a bursting forth of song.”

“And to this song there is no limit?” I asked him.

“When you speak of the soul as being infinite,” said Daniel, “you do not
mean that it extends merely beyond your thoughts, but you mean that you
may heap quantity upon quantity, and multiply quantity by quantity, in
any ratio and at any speed you please, and still have infinity before
you.”

“You mean that these beings understand what is going on in each other’s
mind?”

“They understand all minds as you understand your own. It is of the
nature of spiritual passion to mingle at a certain stage of intensity,
like electricity in the lightning flash. This race has developed a new
sense, just as man has developed senses which are not possessed by lower
animals.”

“And these people were once men?”

“Presumably.”

“And then they have escaped altogether from the sorrows of life?”

“Say, rather,” he answered, “that they have escaped to the sorrows of
life. The essence of life is sorrow.”

“It does not seem so, from your picture,” I said.

“That is simple because my picture is not understood. Every one of these
beings of whom I speak bears in his bosom a pain for which there are no
words; every one of them—there are countless numbers of them, living
each in my consciousness as the voice of one instrument lives in a
symphony—each one is a Titan spirit, wrestling day and night without
end, without possibility of respite, and bearing on his shoulders a
universal load of woe. In no way could you imagine one better than as a
soldier in the crisis of the battle, panting, and blind with pain, dying
amid the glory of his achievement.”

“And such a life!” I cried “Why do they live it?”

“They lived it because it demands with the voice of all their being to
be lived; because the presence of it is rapture and unutterable
holiness; because it will allow no questions, because it is instant,
imperative, and final—_it will be lived!_”

I sat in silence. “Do I gather from your words,” I asked, “that
immortality is not one of the privileges of this race?”

He smiled again. “The spiritual life,” he said, “does not begin until
the thought of immortality is flung away. A man’s duty looms up before
him—and in his weakness he will not do it, but puts the fruition of his
life into another world, where the terms are not so hard!”

“This people,” I asked—“what do they know about God?”

“They know no more than men do,” was the answer, “except that they know
they know nothing. They know that the veil is not lifted. It is not that
for which they seek—life is their task, and life only; to behold its
endless fruition; to dwell in the beauty of it, to wield power of it; to
toil at its whirling loom, to build up palaces of music from it. Ah, my
brother, why have you never lived a symphony?”

“These people have no physical life?” I asked.

“Assuredly, they have,” was his answer, “it is a life which does not
enter their consciousness—any more than, for instance, the beating of
your heart and the renewing of your tissues. They have attained to
mastery over the world of matter. They temper the seasons to their wish;
disease and ill-health they have banished entirely; and understanding
the ways of Nature, they create their food at will.”

“And their society knows no rich and no poor? Their government?”

“They have no government,” he said, “their law is their inspiration.”

Until far into the night we sat talking; and then, early in the morning,
as I went out upon the beach—I saw a ship standing in towards the shore!
I recall, as if it were yesterday, how my heart leaped up, and with what
an agony of uncertainty I stood waving a signal.

And then I rushed to see my brother, shouting the news aloud. Startled
with his own thoughts, he gazed at me in perplexity.

“A ship has come!” I cried. “A ship!”

“A ship!” he echoed; and then with a sudden light: “Oh, I see!”

“Come!” I cried. “They will take us aboard!”

But my brother shook his head. “No Edward,” he replied, “I cannot do
that.”

I started. “No,” he said again, “do not ask me. You go—but let me stay
here until the end!”

“What can you mean?” I cried. “Can you really suppose that I would leave
you?”

“I am not fitted to travel,” he said—“I do not wish to change. And I
could not face the thing which you call civilisation. It has no interest
for me.”

“But we can live in the country,” I cried. “I have money—nothing need
trouble you!” But all my arguments made no impression upon him; he would
only repeat that he desired to be left alone. I tried to move him by
saying that I would not leave him. I might stay if I chose, he said—he
could not help that; but if I were wise, I would leave him to his own
life; and I would not subject him to the pain of meeting the strangers
upon the ship. They would not understand, and they would only cause him
vexation. And even while I was protesting with him, we heard the shouts
of men upon the shore. He rose up and laid his hand upon my shoulder,
and kissed me upon the forehead, saying: “Be wise—or let me be wise for
you. Respect my judgment and let me go.”

And so he turned and started away toward the centre of the island. At
the edge of the thicket he turned and waved his hand to me. I never saw
him again.

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
